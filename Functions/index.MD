# Basics

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. There are many ways of declaring functions in JavaScript.

# Function as a Paramater

The results of a return function can be used as a parameter for other functions.. This should NOT be confused with callback functions however. Callback functions are essentially functions PASSED into other functions which can then use the function (pass in parameters, execute them at a convinient location etc.). This is different from simply using the result of the function for some other purpose.
