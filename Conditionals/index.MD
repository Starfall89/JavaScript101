# Else If

What is key to understand is how else if differs from simply placing if statements after each other. 

If two if statements are placed consecutively, then the conditions don't depend on each other. But if an (else if) is used, then the second conditional will only execute if the first has failed.

# If on the same line
Brackets for both if and else are not necessary if only one line of code is used.
